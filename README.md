### Action RPG Project (GDScript)
- Tutorial Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAbG8Oi-SvQ&list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a
- Status: Complete
- Itch.io: https://xvcrimsajadevx.itch.io/heartbeast-action-rpg-tutorial-final
- Further Developement: Will be extrapolating aspects of both the SimpleRPG and Action RPG tutorials and combining the two in future projects. There was a lot to take away from this project in particular, such as the use of a state machine, the use of colliders, and the hitbox and hurtbox (though I will probably use my own terms for those since I kept mixing the two). Also, the use of reusable components in general. This was an amazing course, and I decided to explore Heartbeast's content further before taking on my own project first.

### Heartbeast's 1-Bit Godot Course (GDScript)
A full comprehensive course that takes you through 4 projects in incrementing complexety and teaches much of the ins and outs of the Godot engine. If you already have some familiarity with the Godot (or game engines in general) the first two projects touch on the most basic concepts, but good for review non-the-less. Project 3 has introduced not just the use of particles, but how to create some simple ones, which is something I hadn't touched on yet. Excited to see what the final project brings.
